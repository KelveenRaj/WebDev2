            My pet dog is my best friend in the world. We sleep together, eat
            together, play together and also love our mom and dad together.
            <br />
            He is not just our pet dog but my brother and an important member of
            my family. <br />The unconditional love and loyalty he shows to us
            are never seen in anybody that I know off.
